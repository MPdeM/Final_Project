# Natural_Language_Procesing

This project is focused on ML. We used a dataset of real and fake job postings from Kaggle [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction/version/1) with textual and non textual information. Our aim was to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) along with other Machine Learning approaches to differentiate fraudulent job postings from real ones. 

We created a website to display some features of the different machine learning models we used.

I hope you enjoy as much as we do with data!!
