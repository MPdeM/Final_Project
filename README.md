#### Machine Learning, Natural_Language_Procesing

![](assets/images/title.PNG)

This project is focused on text classification which is one of the applications of supervised ML. Our aim was to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) along with other Machine Learning (ML) approaches to differentiate fraudulent job postings from real ones. We used a dataset of real and fake job postings from Kaggle [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction/version/1) with textual and non textual information. 

We created a website to display some features of the different machine learning models we used.

### PROBLEM: 
Given the current job market environment, it is important to spot fake job posts. we wanted to create a model that was able to predict which job description was real or fraudulent from the > 17K posts and identify insights from this particular data set. 
### Requirements 

The main requirements for NLP are listed below:

- Tensorflow 
- nltk
- Python 3.6
- Numpy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- PySpark
- Jupyter
- CoLab
- Amazon Web Services (S3)

Web Development:
- JavaScript 
- HTML
- CSS

### DATA
Dataset is freele available at Kaggle Kaggle [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction/version/1) . The data was cleaned and uploaded to S3 bucket. 
### DATA ANALYSIS 
I hope you enjoy as much as we do with data!!
